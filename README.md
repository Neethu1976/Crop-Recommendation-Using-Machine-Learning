# Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning

A machine learning-powered web application that recommends the best crops based on soil and environmental conditions.

## Overview

This project is a Crop Recommendation System designed to help users determine the most suitable crops to plant based on specific soil and environmental parameters. It leverages a Random Forest classifier to analyze user-provided data and suggest crops with confidence scores, making it a practical tool for farmers, agronomists, and agricultural enthusiasts. The app provides detailed crop information, alternative recommendations, and insights into key influencing factors for informed decision-making.
